# xcode-diceapp

This app is a simple dice rolling app which I am creating to learn to code using Swift & familiarise myself with XCode & it's storyboard UI creator.


What I learned from developing this app:
* Use of control flow, functions, variables & constants within the Swift language
* Use of CABasicAnimation library
* Use of the Storyboard UI creator; IBOutlet, IBAction etc.
* Use of Taptic Engine feedback to add to UX
* Learning to use constraints to develop an app focused for iPhones with a notch (this is something I will need to focus on to get a uniform looking app across devices)
